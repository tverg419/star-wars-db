# Star Wars Database
 #### A Brief Introduction: 
Star Wars DB is an interactive database that allows the user to navigate through different categories that contain information related to the first 6 main films of the franchise.

The following project demonstrates the ability to extract data from an API and display it in a responsive, organized manner. The application takes advantage of certain React features (hooks and Router) to allow the user to navigate between different webpages and fetch data as needed.

#### Getting Started: 
The Star Wars API requires no API key or authentication to make requests.

To host the project locally you must: 
1. Ensure that you have `react-router-dom` installed using `npm i`. 
2. Fork and clone the repository. 
3. Navigate into the project directory `star-wars-db` and run `npm run start`

#### Technologies Used: 
- Built using React (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSX)
- Deployed using Heroku
- Google Fonts
- SWAPI (Star Wars API)

#### Major Hurdles
- Intergrating third-party API and displaying information on screen.
- Using flexbox and CSS to create a clean layout for the information

#### Future Work
- Creating responsive mobile design
- Add more information from API (planets, species, vehicles. starships)
- Provide a search function that can serach for any category of information
